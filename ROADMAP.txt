- Actually using the service
    I want to deploy the service in my house to upload and replay guitar sessions!

- Feature request by the project manager (my lovely wife Lindsey <3):
    As a person viewing this website...
    After I pick the session I want to be played,
    I want to see the name of the session.

- Persistence
    I need a system to store and retriece the data that is uploaded.

- Security
    Sessions should only be added through an administrator console, 
    which is hidden from normal users.

- Cloud
    Being able to upload the sound files to a cloud. 
    The server then returns the link to the cloud location.
    Less load on the server

- Hybrid Cloud
    Being able to upload the sound files to different types of clouds.

- Incorporating Generative AI
   The front-end should generate images based on the session and display it by the front end.
